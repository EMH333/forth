# Rust Forth

This was a ~3-day project of mine to create a basic implementation of Forth in Rust as a learning exercise. It is able to handle a fair number of forth "words" and is fairly fast and performant. There is clearly performance, memory, maintainability, and extensibility left on the table, which I may fix at a later date.

I was pleasantly surprised at how straightforward it was to build out the interpreter. In the future, this may be a helpful example project to practice optimizing interpreters/compilers.
